# Units of Measure

A breadth-first survey of **units of measure** — the mathematics of physical
quantities and dimensional analysis (quantity calculus, the Buckingham π theorem, free
abelian groups of dimensions, tensor lines, torsors, dimensioned algebra, and
Kennedy's type-theoretic line), and the checked-units systems fourteen real ecosystems
ship, from compiler-native ([F#][fsharp], [GNAT][gnat]) through static library
encodings (Rust, C++, Haskell, D) and dependent types ([Lean][lean]) to dispatch-time
([Julia][unitful]), runtime registries ([Python][pint]), and symbolic engines
([Wolfram / MATLAB][wolfram]). The goal is a grounded map of the design space to
inform a future **Sparkles quantities library**: the repo's constraints — templates +
CTFE, `@safe pure nothrow @nogc` cores, [`Expected`-based error handling][expected] —
select a specific region of that space, and the survey closes with the delta
([comparison, Part IV][comparison-sparkles]), the D prior art ([d-quantities][dq]),
and three CI-verified runnable D prototypes ([`examples/`](#runnable-prototypes)).

This survey answers seven questions:

1. **What is a quantity — and what, exactly, is wrong with `1 m + 1 s`?** The
   metrology vocabulary (VIM, SI Brochure, UCUM, QUDT) and the six-account orientation
   ledger for the survey's central prohibition. See [concepts][concepts].
2. **What are the classical results?** The π-theorem as rank–nullity over the
   dimension matrix — with the hypotheses folklore elides — and the free-abelian-group
   skeleton every library implements. See [buckingham-pi][pi] and
   [free-abelian-group][fag].
3. **What are the rigorous formalizations of "quantity"?** Whitney's rays and birays,
   Tao's tensor of lines, the torsor/weight-space picture, and Hart's dimensioned
   linear algebra — with what each takes as primitive. See the
   [theory subtree][theory].
4. **How does the algebra become a type system?** Kennedy's line — types-as-invariance,
   AG-unification, erasure — and the six mechanism families that encode the group in
   real checkers. See [kennedy-types][kennedy] and [type-system-mechanisms][mech].
5. **How do real ecosystems package this?** Fourteen systems, from the one compiler
   with the theory built in to registries and symbolic engines. See the
   [master catalog](#systems-master-catalog).
6. **What does the field agree on, and where does it split?** Seven consensus points,
   nine genuinely open trade-off axes, and a candidate unifying hypothesis
   (quantities as a graded object) tested against the evidence. See the
   [comparison][comparison].
7. **Where would a Sparkles units library sit?** The D evidence — two complete prior
   designs, three runnable prototypes — and the open decisions a `docs/specs/`
   proposal must make. See [comparison, Part IV][comparison-sparkles],
   [d-quantities][dq], and the [prototypes](#runnable-prototypes).

## Foundations (theory)

The formalizations, each developed in its own deep-dive. Start with the
[concepts glossary][concepts] for the shared vocabulary, then the
[theory umbrella][theory] for the organizing question (what is wrong with `1 m + 1 s`,
and what is primitive) and the cross-cutting splits.

## Systems master catalog

One row per surveyed system — the identity and classification columns only.
**Checked** is when a mismatch is reported: at _compile_ time, at _elaboration_ (proof
assistant), per JIT _dispatch_ specialization, at _run_ time, or only on an explicit
_opt-in_ query. **Exponents** is the dimension group's exponent domain as shipped.
**Kind** is whether same-dimension, different-kind quantities (`Hz` vs `Bq`, torque vs
energy) are distinguishable. The full per-dimension comparison — affine and
logarithmic support, polymorphism, erasure evidence, diagnostics, compile cost — is
the [comparison's at-a-glance matrix][comparison-matrix]; this catalog is who-is-who.

<sub>¹ Surface syntax defaults to integers, but parenthesized `kg^(1/2)` parses and the
shipped solver is rational throughout — diverging from Kennedy's published `ℤ` design.
² `5.0<Hz> + 3.0<Bq>` type-checks; the stdlib's own `SI.fs` defines both as
`second^-1`. ³ Solver-side `ℤ`; the surface `^:` family takes only `Nat` (negative
powers via `/:`, fractional powers inexpressible). Final release 0.4.0.0 (2022);
GHC 9.0–9.4 only. ⁴ `DTorque = DEnergy` and `DActivity = DFrequency` are type synonyms
by construction. ⁵ Kinds separate `Hz`/`Bq`, torque/energy, and temperature
point/interval, but reset to the default kind under `×`/`÷` — comparability tags, not
algebra. ⁶ Gaussian half-integer dimensions handled by rescaling the basis
(`SqrtCentimeter`); dormant since 2022. ⁷ The field's most developed kind system:
lowest-common-ancestor addition, a four-level conversion lattice, kind algebra closed
under `*`/`÷`. ⁸ Nine-base-unit SI (radian, steradian) makes torque ≠ energy, but
`Bq` = `Hz` survives. ⁹ Explicit policy ("No plans at present to support");
`Angle`/`Information` ship as extra base dimensions instead. ¹⁰ Plus a run-time twin:
`quantities`' `QVariant` throws `DimensionException` (GC + exceptions); all three D
artifacts are dormant. ¹¹ Resolved per JIT specialization: a mismatch compiles to an
unconditional `throw`, a match to bare arithmetic — a third category between compile
and run. ¹² Any `CommRing E` — `ℝ` exponents type-check; the artifact is theorems
(`noncomputable`), not executables. ¹³ Wolfram checks eagerly at evaluation (`$Failed`
on incompatibles); MATLAB checks only on an explicit `checkUnits` query returning
logicals, never raising. ¹⁴ Wolfram curates `DegreesCelsius` vs
`DegreesCelsiusDifference`; MATLAB defaults all temperatures to differences.</sub>

### Runnable prototypes

Three zero-dependency single-file D programs co-located with this tree, compiled and
run by the repository's `ci` helper on every pass (and green under both `ldc2` and
`dmd`); each header cross-links the theory section it demonstrates:

- [`quantity-zn-graded.d`][ex-z] — a minimal `ℤ³`-graded `Quantity`: the dimension is
  its unique normal form as a template value parameter; `metres + seconds` is a
  _checked_ rejection via `static assert(!__traits(compiles, …))`.
- [`quantity-rational-exponents.d`][ex-q] — the `ℚⁿ` variant: CTFE-gcd-normalized
  rational exponents make `sqrt` total (`sqrt(m²)` _is_ the length type) while
  `m^(1/2) + m` stays rejected.
- [`quantity-erasure.d`][ex-e] — representation-level erasure machine-checked
  (`sizeof`/`alignof`/`offsetof`/array layout), with the codegen-identity honesty
  boundary stated.

## Taxonomy

### By checking time

The survey's most load-bearing axis ([comparison][comparison] reads the matrix along
it): _when_ is a dimensional mismatch reported, and by whom.

| **Opt-in query**                  | arithmetic never checks; an explicit call reports a logical verdict        | [MATLAB `symunit`][wolfram]                                                                                                                      |

### By exponent domain

Theory published `ℤ`; practice shipped `ℚ` ([comparison § exponents][comparison-exp]);
the [free-abelian-group page][fag] tallies what the extension costs.

### By kind treatment

The four-rung ladder from [comparison § kinds][comparison-kinds] — no rung is derived
from theory, and [QUDT][concepts] (kind above dimension, as data) sits off-ladder.

## Milestones

A timeline interleaving **theory / formalization milestones** with **system / tooling
milestones**. Every date below is grounded in a landed page of this tree (per-result
provenance in each page's `Sources`); uncertain entries are marked `*`.

## Sources

Each deep-dive carries its own primary-source citations — papers and books (pinned as
local artifacts, with editions and page numbers), SHA-pinned source trees for every
surveyed implementation, vendor-doc captures where a system is closed-source, and
local reproductions (compiler transcripts, codegen diffs) for the load-bearing
behavioural claims. The authoritative artifacts behind this index's classifications
are:

- **Foundational theory** — Buckingham 1914; Bridgman 1922; Drobot 1953; Whitney 1968;
  Curtis–Logan–Parker 1982; Wand & O'Keefe 1991; Kennedy 1994–2010; Hart 1994/1995;
  Janyška–Modugno–Vitolo 2007; Tao 2012; Gundry 2015; Raposo 2018/2019; Jonsson
  2020/2021; Zapata-Carratalá 2021; Bobbin et al. 2025 — as cited in the
  [theory subtree][theory].
- **Metrology primaries** — the VIM (JCGM 200:2012), the SI Brochure (9th ed.), NIST
  SP 811, the UCUM specification, and the QUDT ontology — as quoted in
  [concepts][concepts].
- **Per-system sources** — the pinned project source trees, official docs, and papers
  cited in each linked system page.
