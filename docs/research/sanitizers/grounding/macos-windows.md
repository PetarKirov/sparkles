## Claim ledger

Row IDs mirror the W6 sub-report's claim IDs (`C*` = a survey claim, `A*`/`B*` =
macOS/Windows part). `[source-verified]` rows cite the pinned local trees;
`[literature]` rows cite retrieved-and-saved web docs (🌐); the one `[hw-verified:
aarch64-darwin]` row is the recon smoke test.

## Discrepancies & surprises (all surfaced in the page)

- **D1 — MSVC UAR is a compile-time opt-in, the inverse of `clang_rt`.**
  Stack-use-after-return "requires an extra compiler option
  (`/fsanitize-address-use-after-return`)" and "isn't available by only setting
  `ASAN_OPTIONS`", while clang always emits the fake-stack instrumentation and gates
  it at run time. The page's Windows runtime-control section keys the feature matrix
  on compile flags, not env vars. `[literature]` (MS Learn asan, "Differences with
  Clang 12.0"). ⚠→surfaced.
- **D2 — Windows interception can fail at run time and halts.** The hotpatch
  `debugbreak` is a "sanitizer-infrastructure" halt class with no ELF equivalent,
  called out in the page's instrumentation-model section. `[literature]`. ⚠→surfaced.
- **D3 — Dr. Memory preserves the app's exit code by default** (`-exit_code_if_errors`
  default `0`), the opposite footgun family from ASan's always-fail; surfaced in the
  Windows test-runner-integration section. `[source-verified]`.
- **D4 — LDC ships working Windows ASan libs, yet D exceptions break under them**
  (#3760, open since 2021): "ships ≠ works for idiomatic D." Surfaced as the page's
  `> [!WARNING]`. `[literature]`.
- **D5 — Official LDC ships `libldc_rt.lsan.dylib` for arm64 macOS** even though
  Apple-clang LSan is historically absent (C22) — the official-LDC leak story on Apple
  Silicon may beat Apple's own; surfaced in the macOS defect-classes section as the
  open LSan question. `[source-verified]`.
- **D6 — Windows-on-ARM64 LDC packages ship zero sanitizer runtimes** (`libarm64/` =
  `ldc_rt.dso.obj` only) — the Windows sanitizer column is silently x86/x64-only for D
  too; surfaced in the Windows platform/toolchain section. `[source-verified]`.

## Verification note — blocked hardware

**The macOS column is mechanism-verified, not run-verified**, and the page says so in
its opening `> [!IMPORTANT]` scope box and its closing `> [!NOTE]`. The planned
`mac-bsn` hardware experiments (E-M1 Apple-clang C fixtures; E-M2 the exact
`MallocNanoZone` warning text; E-M3 nix-LDC link mechanism + D fixture catches, LSan
`detect_leaks`, fiber UAR) were **BLOCKED** for the whole session: the only usable ssh
key sat locked in `gpg-agent` and every signing attempt spawned a `pinentry` with no
surface to render on (`journalctl --user -u gpg-agent`: repeated
`ssh sign request failed: Timeout <Pinentry>`). Consequently:

- **Only one macOS row is `[hw-verified: aarch64-darwin]`** — C23, the recon
  Apple-clang ASan heap-UAF smoke test that landed before the key locked.
- **Every other macOS run claim is `[source-verified]` or `[literature]`**, and the
  page marks each as _pending hardware verification_. No claim was upgraded past its
  verification level.
- **The rerun kit is staged** (`scratchpad/w6/fixtures/`: `uaf.c`/`race.c`/`ub.c`/
  `leak.c` + `run-clang.sh`; `heap_uaf.d`/`stack_uar.d`/… + `run-ldc.sh`; one-shot
  `drive-mac.sh`). The open item is registered as a **Q-row** in the survey's
  grounding register; a zero-thought re-run (once `ssh mac-bsn true` unlocks the key)
  splices the transcripts in.
- **The Windows column has no hardware at all** — every Windows row is `[literature]`
  (MS Learn / issues / PRs, 🌐) or `[source-verified]` (LDC source, Dr. Memory clone,
  release-artifact listings). Nothing Windows-tagged is `[hw-verified]`.

## Claims weakened / not made

- **C18 (Dr. Memory on D)** is `[source-verified reasoning]`, not a run — tagged `≈`
  and phrased as expectation, since there is no Windows hardware. The GC-blind-spot and
  no-D-demangler consequences follow from the README/docs + the survey's Linux GC
  findings, not from a Windows execution.
- **C24–C30** from the sub-report (TSan/UBSan darwin transcripts, `MallocNanoZone`
  warning text, nix-LDC D-fixture catches, LSan `detect_leaks`, fiber UAR) were
  **not claimed** — they are the BLOCKED experiment set and appear only as _pending
  hardware verification_ prose, never as ledger ✓ rows.
- **Overhead** — no darwin sanitizer timings and no Windows hardware, so the
  "Platform, toolchain, and overhead" concern's _overhead_ half is explicitly
  unanswered in both columns rather than estimated.

**Net:** 0 fabrications. The macOS link mechanism, packaging, and defaults are
`[source-verified]` against LDC v1.41.0 / compiler-rt `73802c2e` / release artifacts /
`cache.nixos.org` NAR listings; the Windows surface is `[literature]` (MS Learn,
issues, PRs) + `[source-verified]` (LDC source, Dr. Memory `3d2b5f9`, artifact
listings). **Exactly one hardware datum** (C23) carries `[hw-verified: aarch64-darwin]`
— the recon Apple-clang ASan smoke test; all richer darwin behavior is _pending
hardware verification_ (rerun kit staged, open Q-row). Six discrepancies/surprises
(D1–D6), all surfaced in the page; no unresolved contradiction.
